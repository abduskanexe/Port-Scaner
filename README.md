🔍 Port Scanner
Description
This project is a simple port scanner developed in Python to enhance my programming skills and automate security tools like Nmap. The scanner helps identify open ports on a specified IP address or range of IPs, allowing users to evaluate the exposure of services on a networked machine.

Features
Scans for open ports in a specified range or defaults to common ports.
Basic integration with Nmap for detailed port information.
Easy to use via command-line interface.
Supports multiple IP addresses or ranges of IPs.
Requirements
Python 3.x
The socket library (included with Python installation).
Optional: Nmap for advanced port scanning.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Port-Scanner.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copiar código
cd Port-Scanner
Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. If you wish to use Nmap, install it following the official Nmap installation guide.
Usage
Basic Execution
To run the basic port scanner:

bash
Copiar código
python port_scanner.py -t <IP/Host> -p <port_range>
-t: Target (IP address or domain).
-p: (Optional) Specify a range of ports (defaults to common ports).
Example:

bash
Copiar código
python port_scanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1024
Using Nmap (Optional)
If you have Nmap installed, you can use it for advanced scanning:

bash
Copiar código
python port_scanner.py -n -t <IP/Host>
-n: Enables Nmap scanning.
Future Improvements
Implement service detection for open ports.
Improve the command-line interface for easier use.
Add support for scanning UDP ports.
Integrate additional Nmap options for more in-depth analysis.
